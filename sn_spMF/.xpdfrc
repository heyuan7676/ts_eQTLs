# Sample xpdfrc file
#
# The Xpdf tools look for a config file in two places:
# 1. ~/.xpdfrc
# 2. in a system-wide directory, typically /software/centos7/usr/local/software/centos7/etc/xpdfrc
#
# This sample config file demonstrates some of the more common
# configuration options.  Everything here is commented out.  You
# should edit things (especially the file/directory paths, since
# they'll likely be different on your system), and uncomment whichever
# options you want to use.  For complete details on config file syntax
# and available options, please see the xpdfrc(5) man page.
#
# Also, the Xpdf language support packages each include a set of
# options to be added to the xpdfrc file.

#----- display fonts

# These map the Base-14 fonts to the Type 1 fonts that ship with
# ghostscript.  You'll almost certainly want to use something like
# this, but you'll need to adjust this to point to wherever
# ghostscript is installed on your system.  (But if the fonts are
# installed in a "standard" location, xpdf will find them
# automatically.)

# If you need to display PDF files that refer to non-embedded fonts,
# you should add one or more fontDir options to point to the
# directories containing the font files.  Xpdf will only look at .pfa,
# .pfb, .ttf, and .ttc files in those directories (other files will
# simply be ignored).
