## Getting Started


## Overview the the code 

### Perform weighted semi-non-negative sparse matrix factorization (sn_spMF)
`sn_spMF/`: Functions and scripts to run sn_spMF. Detailed description of the functions and scripts can be found in the scripts.
    `run_MF.R`:  Main function to run weighted sn-spMF.
    `fit_F.R`: Update the factor matrix
    `fit_L.R`: Update the loading matrix
###  Map eQTLs to factors using weighted linear regression

`mapping/`: Functions to map eQTLs to factors
    `run_linearReg.R`: Run weighted linear regression
